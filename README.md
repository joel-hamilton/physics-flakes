# Physics Flakes

This is a native Android app, originally built as a learning project; it's a little kistch but I was pretty pleased with how it turned out. Apparently so are the 8 people who somehow stumbled upon it and still have it installed on their devices!

It's legit. It's on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hamilton.joel.physicsflakes)
